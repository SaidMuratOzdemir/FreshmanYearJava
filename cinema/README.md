# Cinema Room Manager Project

This project (https://hyperskill.org/projects/133) was part of the Java for Beginners track offered by JetBrains Academy. 

I practiced creating a cinema theater management application that can perform the following tasks:

- Visualize the seating arrangement by printing it to the console.
- Calculate the profit from all the sold tickets.
- Set the ticket price.
- Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement.
- Handle some input errors.

By completing this project, I gained experience working with input and output in Java. I learned how to deal with arrays and functions, as well as loops and conditional statements.
