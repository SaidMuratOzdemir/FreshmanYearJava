# Exercise2

This code includes methods for the following programming questions:

## Methods

1. `sumDiagonal` - Takes in a 2D integer array as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the major diagonal of the array.

2. `employeeWorkingHours` - Takes in a 2D integer array of employee working hours as an argument, sorts the employees based on their sum of weekly working hours in decreasing order, and returns an array of sum of working hours for each employee.

3. `dotProduct` - Takes in two 2D integer arrays and returns their dot product.

4. `getClosestPoints` - Takes in a 2D double array of points and a double value, finds the closest points to the given double value, and returns an array of indexes of those points.

5. `headsNtails` - Takes in an integer as an argument, generates a 2D char array of 'H' and 'T' of the given size, and returns the array.
