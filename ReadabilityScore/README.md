# Readability Score Project

This project (https://hyperskill.org/projects/39) is part of the Java Core track offered by JetBrains Academy.

In this project, I wrote a program to determine the difficulty level of a given text and for which age group it is most suitable. The program was divided into four stages:

## Stage 1/4: Simplest Estimation

In this stage, I wrote a program that calculates the number of words and sentences in a given text. This stage covered topics such as:

- Scanning user input
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Arrays

## Stage 2/4: Words and Sentences

In this stage, I added the ability to count the number of words in a sentence and calculate the average number of words per sentence in the text. I used arrays and loops to implement this feature. This stage covered topics such as:

- Iterating over arrays
- Functional decomposition

## Stage 3/4: Score!

In this stage, I added functionality to count the number of syllables in a word and use it to calculate the Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability score of a given text. This stage covered topics such as:

- Exception handling
- File I/O

## Stage 4/4: More Parameters

In this final stage, I added even more functionality to the program, such as counting the number of polysyllables and using it to calculate the SMOG index score of a given text. This stage covered topics such as:

- Command-line arguments
- Switch statements

By completing this project, I gained experience with Java programming, regular expressions, arrays, classes and objects, and working with files. I also improved my knowledge of algorithms and formulas for estimating the readability of a text.
