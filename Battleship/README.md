# Battleship Project

This project (https://hyperskill.org/projects/125) is part of the Java for Beginners track offered by JetBrains Academy.

In this project, I created a simple version of the Battleship game that involves two players taking turns to guess the location of each other's ships on a 10x10 grid. The project was divided into five stages:

## Stage 1/5: Take Position

In this stage, I reviewed the rules of the game and placed my own ships on the game field. This stage covered topics such as:

- Introduction to Java
- Scanning user input
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Arrays

## Stage 2/5: The First Shot

In this stage, I implemented the game logic to allow the player to take a shot at their opponent's ships. This stage covered topics such as:

- Debugging techniques
- Logging
- Enums
- Static members

## Stage 3/5: Fog of War

In this stage, I added a feature to hide each player's ships from their opponent behind a "fog of war". This stage covered topics such as:

- Final variables
- Static members
- Enums
- Fields and methods in enums

## Stage 4/5: The End of the War

In this stage, I added conditions for the end of the game, such as when all of one player's ships have been sunk. This stage covered topics such as:

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract classes

## Stage 5/5: Friend or Foe

In this final stage, I added the ability for the game to be played by two human players. This stage covered topics such as:

- Annotations
- Protected modifier
- Hiding and overriding

By completing this project, I gained experience with object-oriented programming principles, programming paradigms, and the JVM, JRE, and JDK. I also learned about types (literals and references), method overloading versus overriding, and how to break down complex projects into smaller pieces. Additionally, I learned the main differences between static and non-static, and how to work with multi-dimensional arrays.
